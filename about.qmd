# About us

Welcome to `discindo.org`! This is a space where we document our learning and 
discoveries as we navigate through the data science + data engineering 
universe. We mostly focus on `R` and `Shiny` and how to build data solutions 
using these in the cloud. Other topics we cover include Py-shiny, 
packages/environments/reproducibility and AWS for R/Shiny/Plumber/Lambda.

Our [projects](/project.html) page has packages and tools we have developed 
as `free software`.

Our [series](/series.html) page has related posts grouped by topic.

Our [website](https://discindodata.com) has description of previous projects 
and references from our clients.

We would love to hear from you! Please get in touch through the 
[contact](https://discindodata.com/#contact) page,
