# About us

Welcome to `discindo.org`! This is a space where we document our learning and discoveries
as we navigate through the data science + data engineering universe. We mostly focus on `R` and
`Shiny` and how to build data solutions using these in the cloud.

Our [projects](/project.html) page has packages and tools we have developed as `free software`.

Our [website](https://discindodata.com) has description of previous projects and references from our clients.

We would love to hear from you! Please get in touch through the [contact](https://discindodata.com/#contact) page, [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/discindo/), or [Twitter](https://twitter.com/podatoci).
