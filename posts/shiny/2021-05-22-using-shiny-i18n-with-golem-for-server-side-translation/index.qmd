In this post we share a useful tidbit we learned while developing the demo for the [`OpenBudgetMKD`](discindo.shinyapps.io/OpenBudgetNMK/) application. 

Like with most projects at Discindo, the `OpenBudgetMKD` application is based on `R` and `{shiny}`. It uses the `{bs4Dash}` and `shinyWidgets` for their excellent UI components, is packaged with`{golem}`, and will be available in Macedonian, Albanian, and English. From a programming perspective, the most interesting aspect for us was implementing internationalization using the `{shiny.i18n}` package and integrating this into a `{golem}`ized `{shiny}` application. These tools integrate seamlessly and make creating rather powerful and great looking applications easy. Many thanks to the developers for creating these awesome packages!

The one small glitch we encountered had to do with dynamically updating the language of choices of `shinyWidgets::radioGroupButtons`. Client-side translation using the usual `{shiny.i18n}` [workflow](https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.i18n/articles/basics.html) was not working, and the proposed [solution](https://github.com/Appsilon/shiny.i18n/issues/54) to translate the choices within an `update` function on the server did not work out of the box in `{golem}` because the `i18n$translator` was not in the `server`'s function scope. Specifically, because the `ui` and `server` of `{golem}`ized `{shiny}` applications exist as separate functions in separate scripts, they [do not share the scope](https://shiny.rstudio.com/articles/scoping.html) (like they would in single-file `{shiny}` applications). Normally, we overcome this by using `global.R` to load objects in the environment that are shared by both `ui` and `server`. But in `{golem}`, there is no `global.R`. So what to do?

Fortunately, we are again spoiled by the versatility of `{golem}`. The solution is to pass the `i18n` translator object as `golem.option` when running the app, in `golem::run_app()`. Then we can use `golem::get_golem_options` to access the translator wherever we need it, e.g., at the beginning of both `app_ui` and `app_server` to make the translator available in both functions.

We include a minimal example of below. See also the [repository](https://github.com/discindo/shiny.golem.i18n).

*****

1. Customize `golem::run_app` to load the translator

```{r}
# R/run_app

run_app <- function(
  onStart = NULL,
  options = list(), 
  enableBookmarking = NULL,
  uiPattern = "/",
  ...
) {
  with_golem_options(
    app = shinyApp(
      ui = app_ui,
      server = app_server,
      onStart = onStart,
      options = options, 
      enableBookmarking = enableBookmarking, 
      uiPattern = uiPattern
    ), 
    # Initiate the translator as a golem.option
    golem_opts = list(translator = shiny.i18n::Translator$new(translation_csvs_path = "inst/app/www/translations/"))
  )
}
```


2. Get the translator from golem's options

- UI

```{r}
# R/app_ui.R

app_ui <- function(request) {
  # calling the translator sent as a golem option
  i18n <- golem::get_golem_options(which = "translator")
  i18n$set_translation_language("en")
  
  tagList(# Leave this function for adding external resources
    golem_add_external_resources(),
    # Your application UI logic
    fluidPage(
      h3("{golem} app and {shiny.i18n} internationalization"),
      h5("(With server-side translation)"),
      br(),
      column(
        width = 4,
        # select language
        radioButtons(
          inputId = "lang",
          label = "Select language",
          inline = TRUE,
          choices = i18n$get_languages()
        ),
        # UI that we'll translate on the server size
        uiOutput("welcome")
      )
    ))
}
```


- Server

```{r}
app_server <- function( input, output, session ) {
  
  # calling the translator sent as a golem option
  i18n <- golem::get_golem_options(which = "translator")
  i18n$set_translation_language("en")
  
  # keep track of language object as a reactive
  i18n_r <- reactive({
    i18n
  })
  
  # change language
  observeEvent(input[["lang"]], {
    shiny.i18n::update_lang(session, input[["lang"]])
    i18n_r()$set_translation_language(input[["lang"]])
  })
  
  output[["welcome"]] <- renderUI({
    
    bg <- switch(input[["lang"]], 
                 "en" = "white",
                 "es" = "yellow",
                 "fr" = "steelblue",
                 "de" = "lightgrey")
    
    div(style = paste("padding: 10px; border-radius: 10px; background:", bg), h3(i18n$t("Welcome")))
  }) 
}
```
