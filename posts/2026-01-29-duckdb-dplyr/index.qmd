Of course, we have all used [duckplyr](https://duckplyr.tidyverse.org/) by now. But now we can use dplys syntax in duckdb thanks to an extension: [dplyr](https://duckdb.org/community_extensions/extensions/dplyr).

I would guess that the inspiration for this comes from the 2023 [Google paper pipe syntax in SQL](https://research.google/pubs/sql-has-problems-we-can-fix-them-pipe-syntax-in-sql/). Since then at least, as far as I know, Databricks adopted it in 2025: [SQL Gets Easier: Announcing New Pipe Syntax](https://www.databricks.com/blog/sql-gets-easier-announcing-new-pipe-syntax).

And now piping is avaiable in duckdb. Fun! But wait...

If you want to try it out and like me install the latest duckdb (v1.4.4 (Andium) 6ddac802ff), the extension will not be avaiable:

```{r}
#| eval: false
INSTALL dplyr FROM community;
HTTP Error:
Failed to download extension "dplyr" at URL "http://community-extensions.duckdb.org/v1.4.4/windows_amd64/dplyr.duckdb_extension.gz" (HTTP 404)
```

Hopefull the maintainer will [fix this](https://github.com/mrchypark/libdplyr/issues/5) soon.
