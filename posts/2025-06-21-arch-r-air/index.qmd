After the Python world got so many new tools, thanks to the people at [Astral](https://astral.sh/), I was super exited to see that the R world is trying to
catch up. 

In particular, Posit made a Rust backed R language server and formatter called [Air](https://posit-dev.github.io/air/).

Then, for no other particular reason than to see how it is done, I created a package for AUR the Arch User Repository of contributed packages. You can find it here: [r-air-bin](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/r-air-bin).

## Why is it named r-air?

Because there is already a binary named `Air`: a Go library [Air](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/air). In order not to overwite the user's system that 
may have the Go binary, the name of the binary for the formatter is `r-air`.

See more at the github discussion with Posit [here](https://github.com/posit-dev/air/issues/347).
