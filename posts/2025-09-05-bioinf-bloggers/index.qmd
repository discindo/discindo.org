About a year ago I started following [r/bioinformatics](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/). I work at a research institute where bioinformatics plays a big role, but not being from that field I wanted to familiarize my self with the topics, problems, and solutions.

Then I bumped into this post: [Any Bioinformatics blogs out there?](https://www.reddit.com/r/bioinformatics/comments/1go98kz/any_bioinformatics_blogs_out_there/)

I started following the blogs in my RSS reader and that worked well. But then I thought it would be nice to have them all aggregated somehow. I remembered how convenient were the old [planet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planet_(software)) sites that followed blogs on a similar topic.

So I decided to build one: [bioinf-bloggers.com](https://bioinf-bloggers.com/).

It is a static html rendered on `gh-pages`. I considered using Wordpress or something like that but it seemed like to much complications.

The repository is on [GitHub](https://github.com/novica/bioinf-bloggers). And contributions in the blogs that it should aggregate are welcome. Just make a PR editing the `feeds.txt` file. Other suggestions are also welcome.
